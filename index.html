        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>SYSTEMS ANALYST, Services Australia (under NCS), AUGUST 2015 – DECEMBER 2022</li>
            <p>Working Age Systems (under Payments, Debt and Child Support Systems branch). Bryan’s responsibilities include analysing business requirements, preparation of user specifications, test case analysis and verification, investigation and resolution of production issues, as well as occasional testing duties.</p>
            <p>Bryan has been involved with several projects related, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single Staff Interface and Automation (SSI): creation and updating of web service operations to streamline the user interface of screens from the current hybrid of legacy (Mainframe) and Customer First screens to Process Direct. The aim of this project is to have one single platform for Centrelink front-end staff instead of navigating between legacy and Customer First screens to process new claim and non-new claim activities. Some of the major web service created are for Student Startup Loan, Special Benefit Details, and Income Summary screens.</li>
                <li>Parental Leave Pay (PPL): legislative changes and Production fixes that affect Working Age System benefit rates. PPL is owned by another system and any changes on their end will need to be investigated and actioned accordingly if the rate of benefits owned by Working Age Systems, such as Jobseeker Payment, are affected. One example is the Flexible PPL project which made PPL payable on a daily basis by week 12 within 2 years instead of one 18-week period.</li>
                <li>Payment Finder: applying actual changes to Payment Finder in order to reflect a more accurate representation of the eligibility and rates of Working Age System payments. The most recent major change is the introduction of the Jobseeker Payment on 20 March 2020 which also gradually retired other payments, such as Newstart Allowance and Sickness Allowance.</li>
                <li>Sunset Widow Allowance: automatic rejection of new claims for Widow Allowance and suggest Newstart Allowance with reporting exemptions instead. Bulk mail is sent to existing recipients of Widow Allowance regarding the ceasing of the benefit and internal transfer to Newstart Allowance.</li>
            </ul>
